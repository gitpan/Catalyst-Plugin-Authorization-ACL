Need to rewrite ACL/Engiine to get rid of Dispatcher::tree warning:

02:04 <@t0m> Caelum: split the path, call get_containers, call get_action on them.. Something like that..
02:05 <@t0m> Caelum: They're gonna delegate to methods on the tree anway under the hood, but the tree should be an implementation detail as far as you're concerned.
02:05 <@t0m> Or, just document how to do it write with Chained, and mark ACL as deprecated :)

Check for any role...earlier on RT:
